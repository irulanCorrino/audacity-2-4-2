## License notice:
this version is redistributed under GPL-3-0-or-later (to my own risk, `Audacity team` [previous maintainers] were reckless enough to have a bunch of incompatible clauses in individual files [GPL-generic vs. GPL-2 vs. GPL-2-or-later], which case effectively invalidate any of their potential claims of license agreement violation)
